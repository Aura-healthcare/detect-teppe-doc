# Project Overview

AURA is an open-source, collaborative, non-profit project. Our mission is to develop a connected device that detects early signs of seizures to alert patients and caregivers.

## Living Lab and Open Science Approach

[The La Teppe](https://www.teppe.org/Presentation) medical facility serves as a unique Living Lab[^1] in France, allowing us to:

1. :test_tube: Test patient adoption of the connected patch
2. :microscope: Validate the effectiveness of the seizure detection system in real-world conditions
3. :stethoscope: Quickly evaluate the integration of these medical devices into medical practices and patient care

[^1]: A "Living Lab" is a methodology where citizens, residents, and users are considered key actors in research and innovation processes.



Our project follows an Open Science approach, which enables:

- Development of an affordable medical device for patients
- Ensuring reproducibility of medical research
- Accelerating medical research by providing documented and reusable software and hardware components
- Guaranteeing ethical practices through transparency in personal data usage and AI algorithm functioning
