# Project Overview

AURA (Automated Unobtrusive Response for Alerting) is an open-source, collaborative, non-profit project. Our mission is to develop a connected device that detects early signs of seizures to alert patients and caregivers.

## Project Goals

1. :heart: Improve quality of life for people with epilepsy
2. :moneybag: Create an affordable and accessible solution
3. :people_holding_hands: Foster a community of clinicians, developers, researchers, and users
4. :rocket: Continuously improve the technology through open collaboration

## Living Lab and Open Science Approach

The [La Teppe](https://www.teppe.org/Presentation) medical facility serves as a unique Living Lab in France, allowing us to:

1. Test patient adoption of the connected patch
2. Validate the effectiveness of the seizure detection system in real-world conditions
3. Quickly evaluate the integration of these medical devices into medical practices and patient care

Our project follows an Open Science approach, which enables:

- Development of an affordable medical device for patients
- Ensuring reproducibility of medical research
- Accelerating medical research by providing documented and reusable software and hardware components
- Guaranteeing ethical practices through transparency in personal data usage and AI algorithm functioning
